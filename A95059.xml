         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have had ≈øome Conver≈øation with the Author of this en≈øuing Declaration, and the Per≈øons Sub≈øcribing, and by experience find them ≈øweetly acted and guided by the everla≈øting ≈øpirit, the Prince of Peace, to walk in the paths of Righteou≈øne≈øs, not daring to venture upon any acts of inju≈øtice; but endeavouring to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, as they would have done to them, having Peace and Joy in them≈øelves, knit together and united in one Spirit of Glory and Truth, Love to their fellow Creatures, Contentation with Food

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165056:4"/>did ≈øet up one man to teach and rule over another; and thereby the Spirit was killed, and man was brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and became a greater Slave to ≈øuch of his own kind, then the Bea≈øts of the field were to him.</p>
            <p>And hereupon, The Earth (which was made to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trea≈øury of relief for all, both Bea≈øts and Men) was hedged in to In-clo≈øures by the teachers and rulers, and the others were made Servants and Slaves: And that Earth that is within this Creation made a Common Store-hou≈øe for all, is bought and ≈øold, and kept in the hands of a few, whereby the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is mightily di≈øhonored, as if he were a re≈øpector of per≈øons, delighting in the comfortable Livelihood of ≈øome, and rejoycing in the mi≈øerable povertie and ≈øtraits of others. From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not ≈øo.</p>
            <p>But this coming in of Bondage, is called <hi>A-dam,</hi> becau≈øe this ruling and teaching power without, doth <hi>dam</hi> up the Spirit of Peace and Liberty; Fir≈øt within the heart, by filling it with ≈ølavi≈øh fears of others. Secondly without, by giving the bodies of one to be impri≈øoned, puni≈øhed and oppre≈ø≈øed by the outward power of another. And this evil was brought upon us through his own Covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, whereby he is blinded and made weak, and ≈øees not the Law of Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe in his heart, which is the pure light of Rea≈øon, but looks abroad for it, and thereby the Creation is ca≈øt under bondage and cur≈øe, and the Creator is ≈øleighted; Fir≈øt by the Teachers and Rulers that ≈øets them≈øelves down in the Spirits room, to teach and rule, where he him≈øelf is only King. Secondly by the other, that refu≈øes the Spirit, to be taught and governed by fellow Creatures, and this was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led I≈øraels Sin, in ca≈øting off the Lord, and chu≈øing <hi>Saul,</hi> one like them≈øelves to be their King, when as they had the ≈øame Spirit of Rea≈øon and government in them≈øelves, as he had, if they were but ≈øubject. And I≈øraels rejecting of outward teachers and rulers to embrace the Lord, and to be all taught and ruled by that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous King, that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Prophe≈øied ≈øhall rule in the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and new Earth in the latter dayes, will be their Re≈øtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from bondage, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.5, 6.</p>
            <p>But for the pre≈øent ≈øtate of the old World that is running up like parchment in the fire, and wearing away, we ≈øee proud Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165056:5"/>fle≈øh, which is the wi≈øe Serpent, ri≈øes up in fle≈øh and gets dominion in ≈øome to rule over others, and ≈øo forces one part of the Creation man, to be a ≈ølave to another; and thereby the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is killed in both. The one looks upon him≈øelf as a teacher and ruler, and ≈øo is lifted up in pride over his fellow Creature: The other looks upon him≈øelf as imperfect, and ≈øo is dejected in his Spirit, and looks upon his fellow Creature of his own Image, as a Lord above him.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>E≈øau,</hi> the man of fle≈øh, which is Covetou≈øne≈øs and Pride, hath killed <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Spirit of meekne≈ø≈øe, and righteous government in the light of Rea≈øon, and rules over him: And ≈øo the Earth that was made a common Trea≈øury for all to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably upon, is become through mans unrighteous actions one over another, to be a place, wherein one torments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>Now the great Creator, who is the Spirit Rea≈øon, ≈øuffered him≈øelf thus to be rejected, and troden under foot by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous proud fle≈øh, for a certain time limited; therefore ≈øaith he, <hi>The Seed out of whom the Creation did proceed, which is my Self, ≈øhall brui≈øe this Serpents head, and re≈øtore my Creation again from this cur≈øe and bondage; and when I the King of Righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe raigns in every man, I will be the ble≈ø≈øing of the Earth, and the joy of all Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ≈øince the coming in of the ≈øtoppage, or the <hi>A-dam</hi> the Earth hath been inclo≈øed and given to the Elder brother <hi>E≈øau,</hi> or man of fle≈øh, and hath been bought and ≈øold from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and <hi>Iacob,</hi> or the yonger brother, that is to ≈øucceed or come forth next, who is the univer≈øal ≈øpreading power of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈ø≈øe that gives liberty to the whole Creation, is made a ≈øervant.</p>
            <p>And this Elder Son, or man of bondage, hath held the Earth in bondage to him≈øelf, not by a meek Law of Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, But by ≈øubtle ≈øelfi≈øh Councels, and by open and violent force; for wherefore is it that there is ≈øuch Wars and rumours of Wars in the Nations of the Earth? and wherefore are men ≈øo mad to de≈øtroy one another? But only to uphold Civil propriety of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Dominion and Riches one over another, which is the cur≈øe the Creation groans under, waiting for deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:165056:5"/>But when once the Earth becomes a Common Trea≈øury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as it mu≈øt, for all the Prophe≈øies of Scriptures and Rea≈øon are Circled here in this Community, and mankind mu≈øt have the Law of Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe once more writ in his heart, and all mu≈øt be made of one heart, and one mind.</p>
            <p>Then this Enmity in all Lands will cea≈øe, for none ≈øhall dare to ≈øeek a Dominion over others, neither ≈øhall any dare to kill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, nor de≈øire more of the Earth then another; for he that will rule over, impri≈øon, oppre≈ø≈øe, and kill his fellow Creatures, under what pretence ≈øoever, is a de≈øtroyer of the Creation, and an actor of the Cur≈øe, and walks contrary to the rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈ø≈øe: <hi>(Do, as you would have others do to you; and love your Enemies, not in Words, but in actions).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore you powers of the Earth, or Lord <hi>E≈øau,</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother, becau≈øe you have appeared to rule the Creation, fir≈øt take notice, That the power that ≈øets you to work, is ≈øelvi≈øh Covetou≈ønes, and an a≈øpiring Pride, to live in glory and ea≈øe over <hi>Iacob,</hi> the meek Spirit; that is, the Seed that lies hid, in &amp; among the poor Common People, or yonger Brother, out of whom the ble≈ø≈øing of Deliverance is to ri≈øe and ≈øpring up to all Nations.</p>
            <p>And Rea≈øon, the living king of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, doth only look on, and lets thee alone, That whereas thou counts thy ≈øelf an Angel of Light, thou ≈øhalt appear in the light of the Sun, to be a Devil, <hi>A-dam,</hi> and the Cur≈øe that the Creation groans under; and the time is now come for thy downfal, and <hi>Iacob</hi> mu≈øt ri≈øe, who is the univer≈øal Spirit of love and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, that fils, and will fill all the Earth.</p>
            <p>Thou teaching and ruling power of fle≈øh, thou ha≈øt had three periods of time, to vaunt thy ≈øelf over thy Brother; the fir≈øt was from the time of thy coming in, called <hi>A-dam,</hi> or a ≈øtop-age, till <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> came; and there thou that wa≈øt a ≈øelf-lover in <hi>Cain,</hi> killed thy brother <hi>Abel,</hi> a plain-hearted man that loved righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe: And thou by thy wi≈ødom and bea≈øtly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made the whole Earth to ≈øtinck, till <hi>Noah</hi> came, which was a time of the world, like the coming in of the watery Seed into the womb, towards the bringing forth of the man child.</p>
            <p>And from <hi>Noah</hi> till <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> came, thou ≈øtill ha≈øt ruled in vaunting, pride, and cruel oppre≈ø≈øion; <hi>I≈øhmael</hi> again≈øt <hi>I≈øaac,

            <p>And Secondly, From <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> till the <hi>Son of Man</hi> came, which was a time of the world, that the man child could not ≈øpeak like a man, but li≈øping, making ≈øigns to ≈øhew his meaning; as we ≈øee many Creatures that cannot ≈øpeak do. For <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> Law was a Language lapped up in Types, Sacrifices, Forms, and Cu≈øtoms, which was a weak time. And in this time likewi≈øe, O thou teaching and ruling power, thou wa≈øt an oppre≈ø≈øor; for look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scriptures and ≈øee if <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Prie≈øts were not the fir≈øt that deceived the people; and the Rulers, as Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, were continually the Ocean-head, out of who≈øe power, Burdens, Oppre≈ø≈øions, and Poverty did flow out upon the Earth: and the≈øe two Powers ≈øtill hath been the Cur≈øe, that hath led the Earth, mankind, into confu≈øion and death by their imaginary and ≈øelvi≈øh teaching and ruling, and it could be no otherwi≈øe; for while man looks upon him≈øelf, as an imperfect Creation, and ≈øeeks and runs abroad for a teacher and a ruler, he is all this time a ≈øtranger to the Spirit that is within him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>But though the Earth hath been generally thus in darkne≈ø≈øe, ≈øince the <hi>A-dam</hi> ri≈øe up, and hath owned a Light, and a Law without them to walk by, yet ≈øome have been found as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in this night time of the world, that have been taught by the Spirit within them, and not by any fle≈øh without them, as <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac, Iacob,</hi> and the Prophets: And the≈øe, and ≈øuch as the≈øe, have ≈øtill been the Butt, at whom, the powers of the Earth in all ages of the world, by their ≈øelvi≈øh Laws, have ≈øhot their fury.</p>
            <p>And then Thirdly from the time of the <hi>Son of man,</hi> which was a time that the man-child began to ≈øpeak like a child grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upward to manhood, till now, that the Spirit is ri≈øing up in ≈øtrength.

            <p>Fir≈øt, Thou ha≈øt made the people to take a Covenant and Oaths to endeavour a Reformation, and to bring in Liberty every man in his place; and yet while a man is in pur≈øuing of that Covenant, he is impri≈øoned and oppre≈ø≈øed by thy Officers, Courts, and Ju≈øtices, ≈øo called.</p>
            <p>Thou ha≈øt made Ordinances to ca≈øt down Oppre≈ø≈øing, Popi≈øh, Epi≈øcopal, Self-willed and Prerogative Laws; yet we ≈øee, That Self-wil and Prerogative power, is the great ≈øtanding Law, that rules all in action, and others in words.</p>

            <p>And all this, Becau≈øe they ≈øtand to maintain an univer≈øal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Freedom, which not only is our Birthright, which our Maker gave us, but which thou ha≈øt promi≈øed to re≈øtore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, from under the former oppre≈ø≈øing Powers that are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which likewi≈øe we have bought with our Money, in Taxes, Free-quarter, and Bloud-≈øhed; all which Sums thou ha≈øt received at our hands, and yet thou ha≈øt not given us our bargain.</p>

            <p>Our Bodies as yet are in thy hand, our Spirit waits in quiet and peace, upon our Father for Deliverance; and if he give our Bloud into thy hand, for thee to ≈øpill, know this, That he is our Almighty Captain: And if ≈øome of you will not dare to ≈øhed your bloud, to maintain Tyranny and Oppre≈ø≈øion upon the Creation, know this, That our Bloud and Life ≈øhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be delivered up in meekne≈øs to maintain univer≈øal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, that ≈øo the Cur≈øe on our part may be taken off the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And we ≈øhall not do this by force of Arms, we abhorre it, For that is the work of the <hi>Midianites</hi> to kill one another; But by obeying the Lord of Ho≈øts, who hath Revealed him≈øelf in us, and to us, by labouring the Earth in righteou≈øne≈øs together, to eate our bread with the ≈øweat of our brows, neither giving hire, nor taking hire, but working together, and eating together, as one man, or as one hou≈øe of I≈ørael re≈øtored from Bondage; and ≈øo by the power of Rea≈øon, the Law of righteou≈øne≈øs in us, we endeavour to lift up the Creation from that bondage of Civil Propriety, which it groans under.</p>
            <p>We are made to hold forth this Declaration to you that are the Great Councel, and to you the Great Army of the Land of <hi>England,</hi> that you may know what we would have, and what you are bound to give us by your Covenants and Promi≈øes; and that you may joyn with us in this Work, and ≈øo find Peace.

            <p>And the Fir≈øt Rea≈øon is this, That we may work in righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and lay the Foundation of making the Earth a Common Trea≈øury for All, both Rich and Poor, That every one that is born in the Land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Rea≈øon that rules in the Creation.

That while you pretend to throw down that <hi>Norman</hi> yoke, and <hi>Babyloni≈øh</hi> power, and have promi≈øed to make the groaning people of <hi>England</hi> a Free People; yet you ≈øtill lift up that <hi>Norman</hi> yoke, and ≈ølavi≈øh Tyranny, and holds the People as much in bondage, as the Ba≈øtard Conquerour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and his Councel of War.</p>
            <p>Take notice, That <hi>England</hi> is not a Free People, till the Poor that have no Land, have a free allowance to dig and labour the Commons, and ≈øo live as Comfortably as the Landlords that live in their Inclo≈øures. For the People have not laid out their Monies, and ≈øhed their Bloud, that their Landlords, the <hi>Norman</hi> power, ≈øhould ≈øtill have its liberty and freedom to rule in Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in his Lords, landlords, Judges, Ju≈øtices, Bayliffs, and State Servants; but that the Oppre≈ø≈øed might be ≈øet Free, Pri≈øon doors opened, and the Poor peoples hearts comforted by an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niver≈øal Con≈øent of making the Earth a Common Trea≈øury, that they may live together as one Hou≈øe of I≈ørael, united in brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love into one Spirit; and having a comfortable livelihood in the Community of one Earth their Mother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:165056:9"/>If you look through the Earth, you ≈øhall ≈øee, That the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, Teachers and Rulers, are Oppre≈ø≈øors, Murtherers, and Theeves in this manner; But it was not thus from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And this is one Rea≈øon of our digging and labouring the Earth one with another, That we might work in righteou≈øne≈øs, and lift up the Creation from bondage: For ≈øo long as we own Landlords in this Corrupt Settlement, we cannot work in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs; for we ≈øhould ≈øtill lift up the Cur≈øe, and tread down the Creation, di≈øhonour the Spirit of univer≈øal Liberty, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the work of Re≈øtauration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In that we begin to Digge upon <hi>George-Hill,</hi> to eate our Bread together by righteous labour, and ≈øweat of our browes; It was ≈øhewed us by Vi≈øion in Dreams, and out of Dreams, That that ≈øhould be the Place we ≈øhould begin upon; And though that Earth in view of Fle≈øh, be very barren, yet we ≈øhould tru≈øt the Spirit for a ble≈ø≈øing. And that not only this Common, or Heath ≈øhould be taken in and Manured by the People, but all the Commons and wa≈øte Ground in <hi>England,</hi> and in the whole World, ≈øhall be taken in by the People in righteou≈øne≈øs, not owning any Propriety; but taking the Earth to be a Common Trea≈øury, as it was fir≈øt made for all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is ≈øhewed us, That all the Prophecies, Vi≈øions, and Revelations of Scriptures, of Prophets, and Apo≈øtles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the calling of the Jews, the Re≈øtauration of I≈ørael; and making of that People, the Inheritors of the whole Earth; doth all ≈øeat them≈øelves in this Work of making the Earth a Common Trea≈øury; as you may read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.26, 27, <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 33.7. to 12. <hi>E≈øay.</hi> 49.17, 18, <hi>&amp;c. Zach.</hi> 8. from 4, to 12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44, 45. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 14.5, 6, 7. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>Amos</hi> 9. from 8 to the end, <hi>Obad.</hi> 17.18.21. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. from 7 to the end, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8.13, 14. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c. Zach.</hi> 14.9.</p>
            <p>And when the Son of man, was gone from the Apo≈øtles, his Spirit de≈øcended upon the Apo≈øtles and Brethren, as they were waiting at <hi>Ieru≈øalem;</hi> and the Rich men ≈øold their Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, and gave part to the Poor; and no man ≈øaid, That ought that he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed was his own, for they had all things Common, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:165056:9"/>Now this Community was ≈øuppre≈øt by covetous proud fle≈øh, which was the powers that ruled the world; and the righteous Father ≈øuffered him≈øelf thus to be ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed for a time, times and dividing of time, or for 42 months, or for three dayes and half, which are all but one and the ≈øame term of time: And the world is now come to the half day; and the Spirit of Chri≈øt, which is the Spirit of univer≈øal Community and Freedom is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen, and is ri≈øing, and will ri≈øe higher and higher, till tho≈øe pure waters of <hi>Shiloe,</hi> the Well Springs of Life and Liberty to the whole Creation, do over-run <hi>A-dam,</hi> and crown tho≈øe banks of Bondage, Cur≈øe, and Slavery.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This work to make the Earth a Common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury, was ≈øhewed us by Voice in Trance, and out of Trance, which words were the≈øe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Work together, Eate Bread together, Declare this all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Voice, was heard Three times: And in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Spirit, Wee have Declared this by Word of mouth, as occa≈øion was offered. Secondly, We have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it by writing, which others may reade. Thirdly, We have now begun to declare it by Action, in Diging up the Common Land, and ca≈øting in Seed, that we may eat our Bread together in righteou≈øne≈øs. And every one that comes to work, ≈øhall eate the Fruit of their own labours, one having as much Freedom in the Fruit of the Earth as another. Another Voice that was heard was this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I≈ørael ≈øhall neither take Hire, nor give Hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ≈øo, then certainly none ≈øhall ≈øay, This is my Land, work for me, and I'le give you Wages: For, The Earth is the Lords, that is, Mans, who is Lord of the Creation, in every branch of mankind; for as divers members of our human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, make but one body perfect; ≈øo every particular man is but a member or branch of mankind; and mankind living in the light and obedience to Rea≈øon, the King of righteou≈øne≈øs, is thereby made a fit and compleat Lord of the Creation. And the whole Earth is this Lords Man, ≈øubject to the Spirit. And not the Inheritance of covetous proud Fe≈øh, that is ≈øelvi≈øh, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:165056:10"/>And if the Earth be not peculiar to any one branch, or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of mankind, but the Inheritance of all; Then is it Free and Common for all, to work together, and eate together.</p>
            <p>And truly, you Coun≈øellors and Powers of the Earth, know this, That where≈øoever there is a People, thus united by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Community of livelihood into Onene≈øs, it will become the ≈øtronge≈øt Land in the World, for then they will be as one man to defend their Inheritance; and Salvation (which is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Peace) is the Walls and Bulwarks of that Land or City.</p>
            <p>Wheras on the other≈øide, pleading for Propriety and ≈øingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt, divides the People of a land, and the whole world into Parties, and is the cau≈øe of all Wars and Bloud-≈øhed, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention every where.</p>
            <p>Another Voice that was heard in a Trance, was this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who≈øoever labours the Earth for any Per≈øon or Per≈øons, that are lifted up to rule over others, and doth not look upon them≈øelves, as Equal to others in the Creation: The hand of the Lord ≈øhall be upon that Laborer: I the Lord have ≈øpoke it, and I will do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Declares likewi≈øe to all Laborers, or ≈øuch as are called Poor people, that they ≈øhall not dare to work for Hire, for any Landlord, or for any that is lifted up above others; for by their labours, they have lifted up Tyrants and Tyranny; and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to labor for Hire, they ≈øhall pull them down again. He that works for another, either for Wages, or to pay him Rent, works unrighteou≈øly, and ≈øtill lifts up the Cur≈øe; but they that are re≈øolved to work and eat together, making the Earth a Common Trea≈øury, doth joyn hands with Chri≈øt, to lift up the Creation from Bondage, and re≈øtores all things from the Cur≈øe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That which does incourage us to go on in this work, is this; We find the ≈øtreaming out of Love in our hearts towards all; to enemies as well as friends; we would have none live in Beggery, Poverty, or Sorrow, but that every one might enjoy the benefit of his creation: we have peace in our hearts, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et rejoycing in our work, and filled with ≈øweet content, though we have but a di≈øh of roots and bread for our food.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:165056:10"/>And we are a≈ø≈øured, that in the ≈øtrength of this Spirit that hath manife≈øted him≈øelf to us, we ≈øhall not be ≈øtartled, neither at Pri≈øon nor Death, while we are about his work; and we have bin made to ≈øit down and count what it may co≈øt us in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ≈øuch a work, and we know the full ≈øum, and are re≈øolved to give all that we have to buy this Pearl which we ≈øee in the Field.</p>
            <p>For by this work we are a≈ø≈øured, and Rea≈øon makes it appear to others, that Bondage ≈øhall be removed, Tears wiped away, and all poor People by their righteous Labours ≈øhall be relieved, and freed from Poverty and Straits; For in this work of Re≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, there will be no begger in I≈ørael: For ≈øurely, if there was no Begger in literal I≈ørael, there ≈øhall be no Begger in Spiritual I≈ørael the Anti-type, much more.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, We have another encouragement that this work ≈øhall pro≈øper, Becau≈øe we ≈øee it to be the fulne≈øs of Time: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Son of Man, the <hi>Lamb,</hi> came in the Fulne≈øs of Time, that is, when the Powers of the World made the Earth ≈øtink every where, by oppre≈ø≈øing others, under preten≈øe of wor≈øhiping the Spirit rightly, by the Types and Sacrifices of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> law; the Prie≈øts were grown ≈øo abominably Covetous and Proud, that they made the People to loath the Sacrifices, and to groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Burden of their Oppre≈ø≈øing Pride.</p>
            <p>Even ≈øo now in this Age of the World, that the Spirit is upon his Re≈øurrection, it is likewi≈øe the Fulne≈øs of Time in a higher mea≈øure. For whereas the People generally in former times did re≈øt upon the very ob≈øervation of the Sacrifices and Types, but per≈øecuted the very name of the Spirit; Even ≈øo now, Profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors do re≈øt upon the bare ob≈øervation of Forms and Cu≈øtoms, and pretend to the Spirit, and yet per≈øecutes, grudges, and hates the power of the Spirit; and as it was then, ≈øo it is now: All pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ≈øtink with the abomination of Self-≈øeeking Teachers and Rulers: For do not I ≈øee that every one Preacheth for money, Coun≈øels for money, and fights for money to maintain particular Intere≈øts? And none of the≈øe three that pretend to give liberty to the Creation, do give liberty to the Creation; neither can they, for they are enemies to univer≈øal liberty; So that the earth ≈øtinks with their Hypocri≈øie, Covetou≈øne≈øs, Envie, ≈øotti≈øh Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Pride.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:165056:11"/>The common People are filled with good words from Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits and Councel Tables, but no good Deeds; For they wait and wait for good, and for deliverances, but none comes; While they wait for liberty, behold greater bondage comes in≈øteed of it, and burdens, oppre≈ø≈øions, taskma≈øters, from Se≈ø≈øions, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Bayliffs of Hundreds, Committees, Impropriators, Clerks of Peace, and Courts of Ju≈øtice, ≈øo called, does whip the People by old Popi≈øh weather-beaten Laws, that were excommunicate long ago by Covenants, Oaths, and Ordinances; but as yet are not ca≈øt out, but rather taken in again, to be ≈øtanding pricks in our eys, and thorns in our ≈øide; Be≈øide Free-quartering, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering by ≈øome rude Souldiers, and the abounding of Taxes; which if they were equally divided among the Souldiery, and not too much bagd up in the hands of particular Officers and Tru≈øtees, there would be le≈øs complaining: Be≈øides the horrible cheating that is in Buying and Selling, and the cruel Oppre≈ø≈øion of Landlords, and lords of Mannours, and quarter Se≈ø≈øions; Many that have bin good Hou≈øe-keepers (as we ≈øay) cannot live, but are forced to turn Souldiers, and ≈øo to fight to uphold the Cur≈øe, or el≈øe live in great ≈øtraits and beggery: O you <hi>A-dams</hi> of the Earth, you have rich Clothing, full Bellies, have your Honors and Ea≈øe, and you puffe at this; But know thou ≈øtout-hearted <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that the day of Judgement is begun, and it will reach to thee ere long; <hi>Jacob</hi> hath bin very low, but he is ri≈øing, and will ri≈øe, do the wor≈øt thou can≈øt; and the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom thou oppre≈ø≈øes, ≈øhall be the Saviours of the land; For the ble≈ø≈øing is ri≈øing up in them, and thou ≈øhalt be a≈øhamed.</p>
            <p>And thus you Powers of England, and of the whole World, we have declared our Rea≈øons, why we have begun to dig upon <hi>George</hi> hill in Surrey. One thing I mu≈øt tell you more, in the clo≈øe, which I received <hi>in voce</hi> likewi≈øe at another time; and when I received it, my ey was ≈øet towards you. The words were the≈øe: <hi>Let I≈ørael go free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, as I≈ørael lay 430. yeers under <hi>Pharaohs</hi> bondage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was ≈øent to fetch them out: Even ≈øo I≈ørael (the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Spirit ≈øpread in Sons and Daughters) hath lain three times ≈øo long already, which is the Anti-type, under your Bondage, and cruel Task-ma≈øters: But now the time of Deliverance is come,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165056:11"/>and thou proud <hi>E≈øau,</hi> and ≈øtout-hearted Covetou≈øne≈øs, thou mu≈øt come down, and be lord of the Creation no longer: For <hi>now the King of Righteou≈øne≈øs is ri≈øing to Rule In, and Over the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, if thou wilt find Mercy, <hi>Let I≈ørael go Free;</hi> break in pieces quickly the Band of particular Propriety, di≈ø-own this oppre≈ø≈øing Murder, Oppre≈ø≈øion and Thievery of Buying and Selling of Land, owning of landlords, and paying of Rents, and give thy Free Con≈øent to make the Earth a Common Trea≈øury, without grumbling; That the yonger Brethren may live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably upon Earth, as well as the Elder: That all may enjoy the benefit of their Creation.</p>
            <p>And hereby thou wilt <hi>Honour thy Father, and thy Mother:</hi> Thy Father, which is the Spirit of Community, that made all, and that dwels in all. Thy Mother, which is the Earth, that brought us all forth: That as a true Mother, loves all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Therefore do not thou hinder the Mother Earth, from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all her Children ≈øuck, by thy Inclo≈øing it into particular hands, and holding up that cur≈øed Bondage of Inclo≈øure by thy Power.</p>
            <p>And then thou wilt repent of thy <hi>Theft,</hi> in maintaining the breach of the eight Commandment, by <hi>Stealing</hi> the Land as I ≈øay from thy fellow-creatures, or yonger Brothers: which thou and all thy landlords have, and do live in the breach of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
            <p>Then thou wilt <hi>Own no other God,</hi> or Ruling Power, <hi>but One,</hi> which is the King of Righteou≈øne≈øs, ruling and dwelling in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, and in the whole; whereas now thou ha≈øt many gods: For Covetou≈øne≈øs is thy God, Pride, and an Envious murdering Humor (to kill one by Pri≈øon or Gallows, that cro≈ø≈øes thee, though their cau≈øe be pure, ≈øound, and good rea≈øon) is thy God, Self-love, and ≈ølavi≈øh Fear (le≈øt other ≈øerve thee as thou ha≈øt ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them) is thy god, Hypocri≈øie, Fle≈øhly Imagination, that keeps no Promi≈øe, Covenant, nor Prote≈øtation, is thy God: love of Money, Honor, and Ea≈øe, is thy God: And all the≈øe, and the like Ruling Powers, makes thee Blind, and hard-hearted, that thou does not, nor cannot lay to heart the affliction of others, though they dy for want of bread, in that rich City, undone under your eys.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:165056:12"/>Therefore once more, <hi>Let I≈ørael go Free,</hi> that the poor may labour the Wa≈øte land, and ≈øuck the Bre≈øts of their mother <hi>Earth,</hi> that they ≈øtarve not: And in ≈øo doing, thou wilt keep the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day,</hi> which is a day of <hi>Re≈øt;</hi> ≈øweetly enjoying the Peace of the Spirit of Righteou≈øne≈øs; and find Peace, by living among a people that live in peace; this will be a day of <hi>Re≈øt</hi> which thou never knew yet.</p>
            <p>But I do not entreat thee, for thou art not to be intreated, but in the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> that hath drawn me forth to ≈øpeak to thee; I, yea I ≈øay, I Command thee, To <hi>let I≈ørael go Free,</hi> and quietly <hi>to gather together into the place where I ≈øhall appoint; and hold them no longer in bondage.</hi>

            <p>And if any of you that are the great Ones of the Earth, that have been bred tenderly, and cannot work, do bring in your Stock into this Common Trea≈øury, as an Offering to the work of Righteou≈øne≈øs; we will work for you, and you ≈øhall receive as we receive.
